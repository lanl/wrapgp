Title: Wrapped Gaussian Process Modeling for Angular Response Data
Version: 1.0.0.0

Description: 
  Contains functions for fitting, predicting, and visualizing Wrapped Gaussian Process models. Wrapped
  models are revelant for angular response data, which assume the data-generating distribution
  is "wrapped" around the unit circle. Gaussian Process models are flexible, non-linear models that can
  be wrapped to accomodate the circular nature of angular response data.
